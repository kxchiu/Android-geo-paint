##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I tested on my HTC One M8, with target SDK of version 23 and min SDK of version 15.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Abount 20~25 hours.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I checked the specs from Android Dev and a lot of StackOverflow discussions.


##### Did you complete any other extensions or additions to this assignment?. #####
